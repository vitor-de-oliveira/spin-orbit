- autogenerate output folder
- check where and how I am using auxiliar_functions_gsl and if they are useful, for example,
in auxiliar_functions. Maybe write a structure to set all relevant information to the integrator. Maybe write a structure for the system, with system dimension, parameters and cycle period, for example, and use this structure inside the integrator structure
- update all commentaries on header files
- write functions for orbital motion using GSL's Newton method and test them separately
