- stabilish the right values for G and m
- check if check_period is necessary according to the 
    equations
- verify if dfdt should be zero in the jacobian_rigid
- autogenerate output folder (write a create dir function)
- write a create file function
- check where and how I am using auxiliar_functions_gsl 
    and if they are useful, for example, in auxiliar_functions.
     Maybe write a structure to set all relevant information to the integrator. Maybe write a structure for the system, with system dimension, parameters and cycle period, for example, and use this structure inside the integrator structure
- update all commentaries on header files
- review includes in header files
- write functions for orbital motion using GSL's 
    Newton method and test them separately
- maybe write a run into makefile
