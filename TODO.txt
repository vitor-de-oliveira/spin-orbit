- understand the differences between the spin-orbit trajectories
using rigid and rigid_kepler as systems. The orbital part is
almost identical. use theta = theta_dot = 0.1
- stabilish the right values for G and m
- pass I as a parameter in the void param (Olhar no dir temp)
- correct badckward integration on phase space function
- check if check_period is necessary according to the 
    equations
- define a structure called phase space and pass it to draw PS
- verify if dfdt should be zero in the jacobian_rigid
- autogenerate output folder (write a create dir function)
- write a create file function
- see what to do with system dimension and what variables transform
into global or something like this
- check where and how I am using auxiliar_functions_gsl 
    and if they are useful, for example, in auxiliar_functions.
     Maybe write a structure to set all relevant information to 
     the integrator. Maybe write a structure for the system, 
     with system dimension, parameters and cycle period, 
     for example, and use this structure inside the integrator 
     structure
- update all commentaries on header files
- review includes in header files
- write functions for orbital motion using GSL's 
    Newton method and test them separately
- maybe write a run into makefile
- think about using C++ and objects. In particular, put the evolve
functions inside the classes.
- verify which mass to use in field_rigid spin orbit equation
- if we implement classes and objects, associate functions like
constant of motion to these classes
